# ASB Auto Subs

A small chrome extension using the jimaku.cc API to automatically download japanese subtitles of the anime episode you are currently watching. Works only on hianime.to for now.

# To Do

- [x] Notify user when no subs there (Or just add some UI/UX lol)
- [ ] Add support for files in zip
- [ ] Add support for other sites
- [ ] Insert subs directly into ASB Player?
